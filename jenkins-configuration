first we have to launch an ec2 instance with public ip enabled

connect to the instance through terminal  -  ssh -i *key-pair* ubuntu@(ip-address of ec2 instance)

update the instance  -  sudo apt update

after that install java  -  sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre

check java installed or not  -  java --version

after that install jenkins by this code  -  

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

or

refer to the official jenkins documentation and select the requred os and copy the given code and run in terminal

check jenkins is installed or not  -  jenkins --version

after that check ec2 security group, because it has to allow incoming traffic.

now check by entering the ip-address with port num in a new tab weather the jenkins is working or not  -  http://(ip-address):8080

now it will ask to unlock jenkins & gives location for the default password,  we have to cat the location and copy the password in our server.

now it shows the password and we have to give it in the jenkins password box.

now it will go to login page & asks to install suggested plugins or to install slected plugins.

go with "install suggested plugins", it will install required plugins

after that it will ask to give new username & password & name, give as you want

after that it will show for jenkins url, leeave as it is and go next, you will be at main dashboard of jenkins.

*************************** jenkins installation is completed ******************************

now docker have to be configured in the same server to be used as an agent

sudo apt install docker.io   -    this command will install the docker

after installing docker, grant permissions to both ubuntu & jenkins user under Docker by root user & restart docker -    

sudo su
usermod -aG docker jenkins
usermod -aG docker ubuntu
systemctl restart docker

now switch to jenkins user  -  su - jenkins

now check if docker is installed and there is sufficient permissions    -    docker run hello-world

if it gives proper responce (hello from docker), then we can consider the docker is installed

if not installed, again use *  usermod -aG docker jenkins
                                usermod -aG docker ubuntu
                                systemctl restart docker

again check if properly installed or not.

after that, restart the jenkins page and again sign-in.

now in dashboard, go to manage jenkins and click on Plugins, now install the docker pipeline plugin in Available plugins box. (download now & install after restart).

after plugins downloaded, now again restart the jenkins.
